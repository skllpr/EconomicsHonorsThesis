[Paper link](./EconHonorsThesis.pdf)

To view additional data and information related to dummy variables, open [DataAnalysis.ipynb](./DataAnalysis.ipynb) and the data is readily available.

### Code, Data, and Analysis Scripts for Honors Thesis

The data was processed through [dataProcessing.py](./dataProcessing.py). [dataAnalysis.py](./dataAnalysis.py) can be used to get all regression analyses. However, the same is available in jupyter-notebook for easy viewing in [DataAnalysis.ipynb](./DataAnalysis.ipynb).

The examination scores for [math](./math), [science](./science), and [overall](./overall) are available in the respective folders. Free/Reduced Lunch data is available at [freeReducedLunch](./freeReducedLunch). Assessment data is in [assessment](./assessment). Yearly enrollment at ASD is in [asdYearlyEnrollment.csv](./asdYearlyEnrollment.csv). The combined dataset is in [DataEconHonorsThesis.csv](./DataEconHonorsThesis.csv), which can be directly loaded into a csv with ease using pandas, R, or almost any programming language with a appropriate package with ease. 

### Future Ideas

I recommend analyzed a smaller section (i.e. limit distance to a maximum to see the effect on a closer region). Also the year range can be expanded further to see a longer timescale effect.
